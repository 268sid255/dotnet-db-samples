These ODP.NET Autonomous DB code samples are intended to be used with the [Developing .NET Applications for Oracle Autonomous Database tutorial](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/tech-info/default-5032178.html). 

This sample demonstrates how to connect to Oracle Autonomous Database, Including Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing and Autonomous Data Warehouse.

Create a new .NET Framework project and add either managed or unmanaged ODP.NET assembly. Managed ODP.NET ([Oracle.ManagedDataAccess](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Oracle.ManagedDataAccess)) can be downloaded from NuGet Gallery. Unmanaged ODP.NET can be added after an [ODAC installation](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/dotnet-odacdev-downloads.html). Paste the sample code into the project. You can then enter your ADB connection and configuration information into the sample code as described in the comments.

This directory contains the 
managed and unmanaged ODP.NET samples. The ODP.NET Core sample is located [here](https://github.com/oracle/dotnet-db-samples/tree/master/samples/dotnet-core/autonomous-db).
