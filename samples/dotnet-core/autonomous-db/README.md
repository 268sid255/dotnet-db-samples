This ODP.NET Core Autonomous DB code sample is intended to be used with the [Developing .NET Applications for Oracle Autonomous Database tutorial](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/tech-info/default-5032178.html). 

This sample demonstrates how to connect to Oracle Autonomous Database, whether it's Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing, 
Autonomous Data Warehouse, or any other variant of Autonomous Database.

You can copy the sample code and configuration setup, enter in your cloud-specific connection information, and connect.

There are three samples, one each for ODP.NET Core, managed ODP.NET, and unmanaged ODP.NET. This directory contains the 
ODP.NET Core sample. The other ODP.NET Autonomous DB samples are located [here](https://github.com/oracle/dotnet-db-samples/tree/master/samples/autonomous-db).
