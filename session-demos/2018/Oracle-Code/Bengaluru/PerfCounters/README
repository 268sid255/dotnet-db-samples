ODP.NET Performance Counters Demo README
----------------------------------------
To run the performance counters demo, modify the connection string and connect descriptor to connect to an Oracle Database with a sample 
HR schema.

For ODP.NET 12.2 or earlier versions, use the OraProvCfg.exe utility included with the Oracle Universal Installer, MSI, or xcopy installs
to register ODP.NET performance counters. Registration is required for the counters to be available in Windows Performance Monitor. 
Run the following command when using managed ODP.NET: 
    OraProvCfg /action:register /product:odpm /component:perfcounter /providerpath:"<directory path>\oracle.manageddataaccess.dll“
Or run the following command with Windows administrator privileges when using unmanaged ODP.NET:
    OraProvCfg /action:register /product:odp /component:perfcounter /providerpath:"<directory path>\oracle.dataaccess.dll“
OraProvCfg.exe is not available in ODP.NET 12.2 and earlier NuGet releases.

In ODP.NET 18 and higher, all installs, including NuGet, will have a batch script for registering the counters.

In the .NET configuration file, set the PerformanceCounters parameter to indicate which counters to monitor. Refer to the ODP.NET 
documentation of the specific version for these counter values. Optionally, you may set the poolName parameter for each pool you wish 
to track. Setting a pool name makes it easier to identify the pool you are monitoring.
